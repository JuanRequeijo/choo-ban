# Choo-ban
Just a simple kanban :)

## Stack
> Basically I decided to not use any boilerplate for this project. To use choo with ES6 imports I took webpack, and to help the development process I used webpack-dev-server. Basically that's it.

### Libs

#### Production
| Lib        | Reason           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| choo | Because you guys told to use it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ |
| nanocomponent | Simple lib to work with components in choo.js |

#### Development 
| Lib        | Reason           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| webpack | ES6 Module imports and simplicity |
| webpack-dev-server | I just love webpack-dev-server, it's simple and very useful |
| babel | Code transpilation and compatibility between browsers |

_That's all_
